        "content": "More often than not we sit and day dream. Sometimes we zone out of physical activity and begin to imagine all we could possibly become or even do. Personally I day dream a lot. I imagine days I will mount the world’s biggest platforms to speak on relevant subjects or be part of staged musicals in big auditoriums filled with people from all over the world. I dream of touring the world and embarking on various adventures such as swimming oceans. I dream of becoming that woman of great influence who will subtly impact the world around her and make living a little better for people. I dream of the businesses I want to own and how they will offer employment to many and put smiles on the faces of not only one person but entire families. I dream… then I snap out. Reality as now will have it, may make it seem like the things we dream of or imagine are farfetched, if not nearly impossible. You may be tempted to look at your current situation and tell yourself “I can never do this” or “this thing is not achievable when you’re in a country like mine”. I dare say the first thing that comes between us and achieving the things we set before us is our mindset. Yes! You said you wouldn’t be able to achieve it so naturally you shut yourself out to all possibilities. When we desire to achieve that seemingly big goal or even dream of occupying that seemingly big position and it seems like it could only be but just a daydream; when we’re tempted to just snap out and say “only in my wildest dreams”; instead of giving in to our negative thoughts, why don’t we choose to believe that in a world of endless possibilities; anything we set our hearts and minds to with the necessary effort and required hard work is possible.Yes it may take time to become a reality but that shouldn’t discourage or stop you. You will surely get there if you take a step at a time in the right direction. So, dream on and dream big!",
